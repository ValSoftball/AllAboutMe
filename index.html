    <h2>My Pet</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I have a pet parakeet. He is green, yellow, and if you put your hand near him, he tries to bite it, but it doesn't hurt, it only tickles. He was born on June 27, 2021 and is now 2 years old. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Friends</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I have four best friends, Nora, Miracle, Sanya, and Bella. I met Nora and Miracle in Kindergarden, I met Sanya in Pre-School, and me and Bella went to swim together in Pre-School with Sanya, but we never talked until she came to my school in 3rd grade and we became best friends. Nora loves planning sleepovers and unusual things. Mircale loves shopping and preppy things, like me. Sanya loves hanging out with friends at the mall and at Lynnfield marketstreet. Bella loves playing roblox, basketball, and soccer. Miracle also loves basketball.</li>
